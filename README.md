# Polygon SeaPort - NFT Api ( Search by name ) 
The current project is deployed on The Graph Hosted Service at: <p/>
 https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/soliditydrone/opensea-erc721-fetcher <p/>
This project currently relies on Seaport contract v3 and v4 to fetch informations about ERC721s. The Seaport also works with ERC1155, feel free to clone this project and get ERC1155 fetching at work.

## How does it work?
If you need to gather data and you're satisfied with the current version of the api you can just use it out of the box.
This api includes Names and Symbols to be easily searched by Name.

If you need to gather more information (I.E. Metadata, traits) then you should create a new Graph on TheGraph site.
Follow the instructions in their wizard, clone this repository and make your changes to include more specific data when fetching.
